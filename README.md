👋 Hi, I'm Tristan.

I'm a research scientist and machine learning engineer working at the intersection of AI safety, interpretability, and computational neuroscience. I bridge theoretical insight with practical implementation to contribute to the development of safe and aligned AI systems.
My core interests and skills include:

- AI safety, alignment, and interpretability
- Novel machine learning architectures for real-world impact
- Neuro-symbolic systems and abstract reasoning
- Computational neuroscience and brain dynamics
- Mechanistic interpretability and transparency in AI systems

🔬 **Current Research & Projects**

**LLM Metacognition Research** (2025-Current)
Research mentorship with Christopher Ackerman through SPAR (Supervised Program for Alignment Research) investigating metacognitive capabilities in large language models. Exploring how LLMs monitor their own reasoning processes, recognize uncertainty, and self-correct. Poster can be viewed here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zwCehQ1a3XeNf6D7Obp2BtOFiib0ABtTx0k7PESQErA

**EEG Seizure Detection System** (2024-Current)
Developing a vector-quantized variational autoencoder-based diagnostic system to assist neurologists in classifying seizure types from EEG brain signals. The architecture uses a novel VAE tokenizer that applies Fourier transforms to raw time series data, enabling transformers to process neural oscillations similar to how LLMs process language tokens. This approach bridges signal processing with modern NLP architectures, creating interpretable representations of brain states that could revolutionize clinical EEG analysis.

**Connectome Harmonics: Brain Dynamics Across the Lifespan** (2022-Current)
Directing an international research collaboration analyzing how structural brain changes influence neural dynamics throughout aging. Using a novel mathematical framework called "Connectome Harmonics," we're processing large-scale neuroimaging datasets from the University of Oxford to reveal new insights into cognitive decline. This work combines spectral graph theory, complex systems analysis, and large-scale data processing to uncover potential biomarkers for age-related neurodegeneration.

🧠 **Inspirations & Interests**
I draw inspiration from thinkers like Joscha Bach, Douglas Hofstadter, Selen Atasoy, and Leonid Perlovsky; researchers who bridge disciplines to understand intelligence, consciousness, and complex systems.

Outside of research, I explore meditation, philosophy, and music. I've traveled to 16 countries and counting, always curious about how different perspectives shape understanding.
